# GiveAway
A new Flutter mobile application for a hackathon

## Introduction
This project is my first attempt at building a full-fledged mobile application using Flutter and Firebase. It is an app for users in a community to buy, sell or donate old items, rather than them going to waste. This can act towards environment sustainability and building a sense of community, as well as reducing carbon footprint.
